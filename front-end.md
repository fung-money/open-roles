# :eye_speech_bubble: Fung's vision 
Fung’s vision of the future is a world where **digital assets and payments are the new normal**. Purchasing digital assets should not feel as exclusive concept reserved only for the savviest 1%. It should be as simple as buying a T-shirt online with your card. To be part of this future, E-commerce **needs reliable infrastructure**, where cryptocurrency and fiat payments are handled alike. Fung is building for this future, as the first Regulated Payments Platform with **fiat and crypto rails at its core design**. 

Actually, **the future is now** — NFTs.

We’ve seen a crazy boom of this newborn industry starting in 2021. We’ve seen the biggest brands getting onboard, however not with the help of their payment providers. We’ve seen a lot of uncertainty, questionable practices and lack of established legal and operational frameworks around it.

We know there’s a lot more to NFTs, and this is just the start. The regulators also know this and they are already working on it.

With all of this in mind, and our **perspective coming from years of experience** in payments, finance and compliance, we got together with the mission to build Fung as a regulated full-stack Payments Platform. To **address the needs of the next-generation** Merchants and Marketplaces waiting to step into this future.

*MVP is launching end of March on the Cardano blockchain.*
